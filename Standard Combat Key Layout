---For AFK---
1: GSE Single Target
2: Loot - Note: Loot-a-Rang is preferable. If not available, use macro /targetlast (??) + interact with target hotkey (need to figure out how to combine those into one for when I'm actually playing and not using AHK)
3: Heal
4: Mount - Don't use Mammoth here due issues getting stuck
5: Utility

---Non-AFK---
1: GSE Singtargetrget - Note: For AoE//Multi-Target set up via Logitech software. If a second hotkey is required (not a modifier), set to higher hotkey (like 8 or 9).
2: Loot - Note: Loot-a-Rang is preferable. If not available, use macro /targetlasttarget + interact with target hotkey (need to figure out how to combine those into one for when I'm actually playing and not using AHK)
